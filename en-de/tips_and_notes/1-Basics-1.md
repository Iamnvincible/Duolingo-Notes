### Welcome to German :)

Welcome to the German course! We will provide you with tips and notes throughout the course. However, be aware that these are optional. Only read them when you feel stuck, or when you are interested in the details. You can use the course without them.

Often, it's best to just **dive into the practice**. See how it goes! You can always revisit the Notes section later on.

### Capitalizing nouns

In German, **all nouns are capitalized**. For example, "my name" is _mein **N**ame_, and "the apple" is _der **A**pfel_. This helps you identify which words are the nouns in a sentence.

### German genders are strange

Nouns in German are either **feminine, masculine or neuter**. For example, _Frau_ (woman) is feminine, _Mann_ (man) is masculine, and _Kind_ (child) is neuter.

While some nouns (Frau, Mann, …) have **natural gender** like in English (a woman is female, a man is male), **most nouns have grammatical gender** (depends on word ending, or seemingly random).

For example, _Mädchen_ (girl) is neuter, because all words ending in _-chen_ are neuter. _Wasser_ (water) is neuter, but _Cola_ is feminine, and _Saft_ (juice) is masculine.

It is important to **learn every noun along with its gender** because parts of German sentences change depending on the gender of their nouns.

For now, just remember that the **indefinite article** (a/an) _ein_ is used for masculine and neuter nouns, and _eine_ is used for feminine nouns. Stay with us to find out how "cases" will later modify these.

| gender    | indefinite article |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| masculine | **ein** Mann       |
| neuter    | **ein** Mädchen    |
| feminine  | **eine** Frau      |

### Verb conjugations

#### Conjugating regular verbs

**Verb conjugation** in German is more complex than in English. To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the stem of the verb and **add the ending** corresponding to any of the grammatical persons, which you can simply memorize. For now, here are the singular forms:

Example: _trinken_ (to drink)

| English person          | ending | German example       |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| I                       | -e     | ich trink**e**       |
| you (singular informal) | -st    | du trink**st**       |
| he/she/it               | -t     | er/sie/es trink**t** |

#### Conjugations of the verb _sein_ (to be)

Like in English, _sein_ (to be) is completely irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized. Again, you will learn the plural forms soon.

| English                     | German            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| I am                        | ich **bin**       |
| you (singular informal) are | du **bist**       |
| he/she/it is                | er/sie/es **ist** |

### Umlauts

**Umlauts** are letters (more specifically vowels) that have two dots above them and appear in some German words like _Mädchen_.

_Literally, "Umlaut" means "around the sound," because its function is to change how the vowel sounds._

| no umlaut | umlaut |
| --------- | ------ |
| a         | ä      |
| o         | ö      |
| u         | ü      |

An umlaut change may change the meaning. That's why it's important not to ignore those little dots.

If you can't type these, a workaround is to type "oe" instead of "ö", for example.

### No continuous aspect

In German, there's **no continuous aspect**. There are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: _Ich trinke._

There's no such thing as _Ich bin trinke_ or _Ich bin trinken!_

_When translating into English, how can I tell whether to use the simple (I drink) or the continuous form (I am drinking)?_

Unless the context suggests otherwise, either form should be accepted.
