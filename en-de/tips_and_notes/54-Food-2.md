#### _Küche_ vs. _Kuchen_

_Die Küche_ (the kitchen) and _der Kuchen_ (the cake) are often confused by learners. To German ears, they sound quite different. One reason is that in _Küche_, the vowel is short, while the vowel in _Kuchen_ is long.

| singular       | plural         |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| die K**ü**che  | die K**ü**chen |
| der K**u**chen | die K**u**chen |

_Kochen_ (to cook) also has a short vowel.

#### _Schmecken_

_Schmecken_ is very similar to the English word "to taste":

- Ich schmecke Knoblauch! (I taste garlic!)
- Knoblauch schmeckt super! (Garlic tastes great!)

In addition, _schmecken_ can be used by itself:

- Die Pizza schmeckt nicht! (The pizza does not taste _good_!)

### Some popular food

#### _Müsli_

_Müsli_ originally refers to "Bircher Müesli", a Swiss breakfast dish, based on rolled oats and fresh or dried fruits.

Nowadays, people will use it for all kinds of cereals or granola, often with high sugar content.

#### _Hähnchen_

_Hähnchen_ usually refers to a chicken that has been turned into a dish. While derived from the word for "male chicken" (_der Hahn_), the only distinction today is that it is a food item.

Remember that words ending in _-chen_ are always neuter: _das Hähnchen_.

#### _Salat_

_Salat_ can refer to the dish, as well as to the green leaves (usually lettuce) that often go into it.
