### Dative plural: "n" all the way!

Remember that the ending for articles, pronouns and adjectives is *-n* in dative plural:

* mit de*n* alte*n* Autos (with the old cars)

In addition, plural nouns that do not end in *-n* already will also get an *-n*:

* der Freund, die Freunde (the friend, the friends)
* mit meine*n* alte*n* Freunde*n* (with my old friends)

As you can see above, *-s* plural endings break this rule.
