### Comparative

The comparative for short words in English is commonly formed by adding *-er* to the adjective:

* fast, faster
* smart, smarter

German works in the same way. Of course, you then have to add the correct adjective ending to the whole thing:

* schnell, schneller
* ein schneller Mann, ein schneller*er* Hund, eine schneller*e* Katze (a fast man, a faster dog, a faster cat)

For longer adjectives, English uses "more" instead. German does not do that.

* interesting, more interesting
* interessant, interessant*er*

Short adjectives usually get an umlaut change, though:

* alt, *ä*lter
* groß, gr*ö*ßer

Remember that *gern* is an adverb. German uses it to describe things it likes. It has the comparative *lieber*:

* Ich esse *gern* Pizza. Ich esse *lieber* Lasagne.
* I like to eat pizza. I prefer to eat lasagna.

### *Seit*

In English, you can say:

* I have been learning German for two months.

In German, you would instead say:

* Ich lerne seit zwei Monaten Deutsch.

First, as it is still ongoing, the present tense is used.

Second, German uses *seit* for stretches of time that reach into the present. That means you can only use it for things that are still ongoing.

If *seit* is combined with a noun, it takes the dative. Remember that in dative plural, the noun gets an extra *-n*:

* der Monat, die Monate > seit zwei Monate*n*

### *Anfang, Mitte, Ende*

In English, "early, mid, late" refers to positions in a day, month, or year:

* in *late* May

In German, *Anfang, Mitte, Ende* can be used like this:

* *Ende* Mai

These can also be used for age:

* Sie ist *Anfang zwanzig*. (She is in her early twenties.)
