### _Im_ vs. _ins_

For now, think of _im_ as "inside", and "ins" as "into":

- Ich bin im Theater. (I am inside the theater.)
- Ich gehe ins Theater. (I go into the theater.)

Later on, you will see these are part of a larger pattern.

_Im_ is also used for months and seasons:

- Im Juli, im Winter

### Verb forms: you (plural)

So far, you learned these verb forms:

|              | learn  | drive  | have  |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| infinitive   | lernen | fahren | haben |
| ich          | lerne  | fahre  | habe  |
| du (you sg.) | lernst | fährst | hast  |
| er/sie/es    | lernt  | fährt  | hat   |
| wir          | lernen | fahren | haben |
| sie          | lernen | fahren | haben |

Here you learn the form for the last person, "you (plural)".

This form always has a "-t" ending, and the stem of the verb will always be the same as the infinitive. Contrast with the third person singular, where there may be stem changes:

|               | learn   | drive   | have   |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| infinitive    | lernen  | fahren  | haben  |
| er/sie/es     | lernt   | f*ä*hrt | hat    |
| ihr (you pl.) | lern*t* | fahr*t* | hab*t* |

### _Gern_

In English, you can say:

- I like chocolate. I like to swim.

Previously, you learned "mögen" means "to like":

- Ich mag Schokolade.

However, this can only be used with nouns. For verbs, there is a structure that English does not use. It is therefore often confusing for beginners of German.

- Ich schwimme _gern_.

_Gern_ is an adverb, not a verb. Literally, Germans say "I swim likingly." Here's a tip: If you know where in the sentence to put "oft" (often), you know where to put "gern":

- Ich gehe _oft_ ins Theater. (I often go to the theater.)
- Ich gehe _gern_ ins Theater. (I like to go to the theater.)

_Gern_ may be written/spoken as _gerne_, these two forms are exactly the same.
