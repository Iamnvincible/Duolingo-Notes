#### Sehenswürdigkeiten?!

The word *Sehenswürdigkeit* (*sight* as in *sightseeing*) is made up of several meaningful parts: *sehen* + *s* + *würdig* + *keit*.

Let's look at each part and its meaning.

| Part   | Meaning                   |
|--------|---------------------------|
| sehen  | to see                    |
| -s-    | connecting element        |
| würdig | to be worthy              |
| -keit  | noun suffix               |

Literally *Sehenswürdigkeit* means *something which is worthy to see*.

The connecting element *-s-* is used to link words together. 

The ending *-keit* turns an adjective into a noun.

Often the ending of a compound noun is a good indicator for the gender of the noun. For example, if a noun ends in *-keit*, it will always be feminine (die).

#### *Urlaub* vs. *Ferien*

Just like in English there's "holidays" and "vacation", in German there are *Ferien* and *Urlaub*. They can be used interchangeably to some extent.

*Ferien* only exists as a plural noun:

* Die Ferien sind im Sommer. (The holidays are in summer.)

*Urlaub* only exists as a singular noun:

* Wann ist der Urlaub? (When is the vacation?)

#### *Visum*

In English, you need "a visa". In German, the singular is *das Visum*, *Visa* is the plural (as it is in Latin, the source language of this word).

#### *Weg* vs. *weg*

*Der Weg* (with a long *-e-*) roughly means "the path".

* Der Weg ist lang. (The path is long.)

The word *weg* (with a short, open *-e-*) roughly means "away". Here are some examples:

* Geh *weg*! (Go away!)
* Ich bin *weg*! (I'm gone!)
