### _Zu Mittag_, _zu Abend_

In some combinations, prepositions are not grammatical. Just learn the whole phrase like a word:

| German     | English        |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| zu Fuß     | on foot        |
| zu Mittag  | for lunch      |
| zu Abend   | for dinner     |
| zu Hause   | _at_ home      |
| nach Hause | _towards_ home |

Especially _zu Hause_ is often confusing, as in regular use, _zu_ often means _towards_.

### _Geben_

_Geben_ (to give) is one of several verbs that describe a transaction. These generally have two objects:

- the _direct object_ is what changes hands. This is the object you already know: it is in the accusative case.
- the _indirect object_ identifies the "other person involved" in a transaction. This object is in the dative case.

- Ich gebe _einem Kind_ _einen Apfel_. (I give a child an apple.)

As in English, the dative "indirect" object comes before the accusative "direct" object.

English can also use "to": "I gave an apple to a child." — this is not possible in German.

_Geben_ is a strong (slightly irregular) verb, here are its forms:

| Person      | geben   |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ich         | gebe    |
| du          | _gibst_ |
| er/sie/es   | _gibt_  |
| wir         | geben   |
| ihr         | gebt    |
| sie/Sie     | geben   |
| perf. part. | gegeben |
