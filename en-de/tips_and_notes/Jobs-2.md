### _Student_ or _Schüler?_

**_Ein Student_ is a university student** and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### Dropping articles

When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as _I'm a teacher_ or _She's a judge_, German speakers **usually drop the indefinite article** _(ein/eine)_.

- Ich bin Lehrer. (I am **a** teacher.)

It sounds more natural to say _Ich bin Lehrer_ and _Sie ist Richterin_ than _Ich bin ein Lehrer_ and _Sie ist eine Richterin_. This rule also applies to students.

If you **add an adjective**, you **can't drop the article**. _Er ist ein schlechter Arzt_ (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but _Er ist schlechter Arzt_ is not.

Also note that **you can't drop the definite article** _(der/die/das)_.

#### Male and female variants

The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to.

So the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically feminine.

In the vast majority of cases, **the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix _-in_ to the male variant**, e.g. _der Bäcker_ becomes _die Bäckerin_ and _der Schüler_ (the pupil) becomes _die Schülerin_.

**The plural** of the female variant **is formed by adding the ending _-innen_** to the singular of the male variant, e.g. _die Bäcker**innen**_ and _die Schüler**innen**_.

Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female variant as well.

|        | singular       | plural            |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| male   | der Koch       | die K**ö**che     |
| female | die K**ö**chin | die K**ö**chinnen |

You learn one more word like this in this lesson:

- der **A**rzt, die **Ä**rztin (the doctor)

#### _Sie ist der Boss!_

There are a few words for people where the grammatical and the natural gender differ. One of them is _der Boss_. There is no feminine version for it, although there are certainly female bosses.

- **Mein** Boss heißt Linda Ackermann.
- **Meine** Chef**in** heißt Linda Ackermann.
