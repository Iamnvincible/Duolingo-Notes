### Polite "you"

Remember that German has two ways of expressing "you" (singular and plural)?

Surprise! There is a third form, usually used with people you don't know well. German just uses the third person plural for this (they):

| person  | trinken |
| ------- | ------- |
| du      | trinkst |
| ihr     | trinkt  |
| sie/Sie | trinken |

How to know whether the meaning is "they" or "you"? German writes the "you" forms in upper case.

- Wo sind sie? (Where are they?)
- Wo sind Sie? (Where are you?)

Of course, at the beginning of the sentence, this does not work. It can then mean both:

- Sie sind da! (They/You are there!)

When using the polite form, you usually combine it with the last name of a person, and _Herr/Frau_:

- Guten Tag, Herr Müller! (Good day, Mr Müller!)
- Willkommen, Frau Schmidt! (Welcome, Mrs Schmidt!)

### Noun endings

As mentioned earlier, sometimes a noun endings gives away the gender:

- -chen (das)
- -er (often _der_)
- -e (often _die_)

A common way to turn a verb into a noun is to add _-ung_ to the word stem. These nouns will always be feminine:

- die Wohnung, die Reservierung, die Rechnung

Later on, you will learn more of these regular noun endings.

### _Cup of tea_

In German, you just add the quantity before the noun:

- eine Tasse Tee (one cup of tea)
- ein Glas Milch (one glass of milk)

### _Willkommen_

_Willkommen_ only means _welcome_ as a greeting. It will not mean _you're welcome_.

### Past tense

As in English, you can use the present tense to talk about the present and the future:

- Ich esse! (I am eating!)
- Ich gehe morgen ins Theater. (I go to the theatre tomorrow.)

Also as in English, the past requires a different tense. Here, you learn how to say "I was":

- Ich war gestern im Theater. (I was at the theater yesterday.)

The endings are like those of the modal verbs (_müssen, können, …_). But the stem never changes:

| Person    | sein (to be) | können (can) |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| ich       | war          | kann         |
| du        | war*st*      | kann*st*     |
| er/sie/es | war          | kann         |
| wir       | war*en*      | könn*en*     |
| ihr       | war*t*       | könn*t*      |
| sie/Sie   | war*en*      | könn*en*     |

#### I went to Ireland!

Many learners of German struggle with expressing where they went:

- I _went to_ Ireland.

Germany is actually simpler here: it just uses _ich war_:

- Ich _war_ in Irland.
