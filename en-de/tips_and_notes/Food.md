### The German Preposition *am*

Most likely, food is being consumed at the table. The German preposition *am* is the contraction of *an* (at/on) and *dem* (the). For example, *The man eats at the table* is *Der Mann isst am (an + dem) Tisch.* Since *an* can translate to both *at* and *on,* *am* can translate to both *at the* and *on the,* depending on the context. For example *an dem Tisch* only translates to *at the table* (context: spatial relationship between things) and *an dem Tag* only translates to *on that day* (context: temporal).

### The verb *haben* (to have)

In English, you can say "I'm having bread" when you really mean that you're eating or about to eat bread. **This does not work in German.** The verb ***haben* refers to possession only.** Hence, the sentence *Ich habe Brot* only translates to *I have bread*, not *I'm having bread.* Of course, the same applies to drinks. *Ich habe Wasser* only translates to *I have water,* not *I'm having water.*

### Mittagessen* - lunch or dinner?

We're aware that *dinner* is sometimes used synonymously with *lunch,* but for the purpose of this course, we're defining *Frühstück* as *breakfast,* *Mittagessen* as *lunch,* and *dinner* / *supper* as *Abendessen* / *Abendbrot.*

### Compound words

A compound word is a word that consists of two or more words. These are written as one word (no spaces). 

The gender of a compound noun is always determined by its last element. This shouldn't be too difficult to remember because the last element is always the most important one. All the previous elements merely describe the last element.

* **die** Auto**bahn** (das Auto + die Bahn)

* **der** Orangen**saft** (die Orange + der Saft)

* **das** Hunde**futter** (der Hund + das Futter)

Sometimes, there's a connecting sound (*Fugenlaut*) between two elements. For instance, *die Orange* + *der Saft* becomes *der Orange**n**saft,* *der Hund* + *das Futter* becomes *das Hund**e**futter*, *die Liebe* + *das Lied* becomes *das Liebe**s**lied*, and *der Tag* + *das Gericht* becomes *das Tag**es**gericht*.

### Cute like sugar!

The word *süß* means *sweet* when referring to food, and *cute* when referring to living beings.

* Der Zucker ist süß. (The sugar is sweet.)
* Die Katze ist süß. (The cat is cute.)
