### _Fressen_ vs. _essen_

The German word for "to eat" is _essen_. However, many people use a different word for animals:

- Die Frau isst. Die Katze frisst.

The forms of both verbs are the same:

| person      | essen    | fressen   |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| ich         | esse     | fresse    |
| du          | isst     | frisst    |
| er/sie/es   | isst     | frisst    |
| wir         | essen    | fressen   |
| ihr         | esst     | fresst    |
| sie/Sie     | essen    | fressen   |
| perf. part. | gegessen | gefressen |

### Natural vs. grammatical gender

Remember that for most nouns in German, the word determines the gender, not the meaning:

- _der_ Becher, _die_ Tasse, _das_ Glas (the mug, the cup, the glass)

For animals, there is usually a general word with a certain grammatical gender. "Katze" is feminine. That does not mean that the specific cat is necessarily female!

- die: Katze, Spinne, Schildkr√∂te, Schlange, Kuh, Maus
- der: Hamster, Hund, Vogel
- das: Insekt, Huhn, Tier, Schaf, Schwein, Pferd, Kaninchen

German has specific male/female versions for some of these, but we do not teach them at this point.

### Favorite

_Liebling_ means "darling":

- Mein Liebling! (My darling!)

When combined with other nouns, it means "favorite":

- meine Liebling*s*katze (my favorite cat)

Note that German often glues an "s" or an "n" between two noun word parts.

### _Danken_

Similar to _helfen_ (to help), _danken_ is part of a small number of verbs that only have a dative object:

- Ich helfe dem Mann.
- Ich danke dem Mann.

Think of "giving help/thanks to" somebody, and you will get it right.

### _Angst haben_

Instead of "to be afraid of", German says "I have fear of":

- Ich _habe Angst vor_ Hunden. (I am afraid of dogs.)

It is sometimes necessary to learn the preposition together with the verb. _Vor_ takes the dative when used together with _Angst haben_.
