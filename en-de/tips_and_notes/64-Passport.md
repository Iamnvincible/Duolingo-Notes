### Yes/No Questions

Questions can be asked by **switching the subject and verb**. For instance,

- _Du verstehst_ das. (You understand this.)

becomes

- _Verstehst du_ das? (Do you understand this?).

These kinds of questions will generally just elicit yes/no answers. In English, the main verb "to be" follows the same principle. "You are hungry." becomes "Are you hungry?".

In German, all verbs follow this principle. **There's no do-support**.

### Asking a Question in German With a W-Word

There are seven W-questions in German:

| English   | German  |
| --------- | ------- |
| what      | was     |
| **who**   | **wer** |
| **where** | **wo**  |
| when      | wann    |
| how       | wie     |
| why       | warum   |
| which     | welcher |

Don't mix up _wer_ and _wo_, which are "switched" in English :)

Some of these will change according to case.

#### _Was_ (what)

If you ask _was_ with a preposition, the two normally turn into a new word, according to the following pattern:

| English    | preposition | wo-         |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| for what   | für         | wofür       |
| about what | über        | wo**r**über |
| with what  | mit         | wo**mit**   |

If the preposition starts with a vowel, there will be an extra _-r-_ to make it easier to pronounce.

This _wo-_ prefix does **not** mean "where".

#### _Wer_ (who)

_Wer_ is declinable and needs to **adjust to the cases**. The adjustment depends on what the question is targeting.

If you ask for the subject of a sentence (i.e. the nominative object), _wer_ (who) remains as is:

- _Wer_ ist da? (Who is there?).

If you ask for the direct (accusative) object in a sentence, _wer_ changes to _wen_ (who/whom). As a mnemonic, notice how _wen_ rhymes with _den_ in _den Apfel_.

- _Wen_ siehst du? — Ich sehe _den_ Hund.
- (Whom do you see? — I see the dog.)

You will soon learn about the Dative case. You have to use _wem_ then. And there is a forth case in German (Genitive). You would use _wessen_ here. This corresponds to English "whose".

The endings look like the endings of _der_ (but don't change with gender/number):

| case       | masc. | Form of _wer_ |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------- |
| nominative | der   | wer           |
| accusative | den   | wen           |
| dative     | dem   | wem           |

#### _Welche(r/s)_ (which)

_Welche-_ words are used to ask about for a specific item out of a group of items, such as "which car is yours?".

This declines not only for case, but also for gender. The endings are the same as for definite articles:

| article       | welch\*     |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| de**r**       | welche**r** |
| da**s**       | welche**s** |
| di**e**       | welch**e**  |
| di**e** (pl.) | welch**e**  |
| de**n**       | welche**n** |

#### _Wo_ (where)

In German, you can inquire about locations in several ways.

_Wo_ (where) is the general question word, but if you are **asking for a direction** in which someone or something is moving, you may **use _wohin_** (where to).

Consider these examples:

- _Wo_ ist mein Schuh? (Where is my shoe?)

- _Wohin_ gehst du? (Where are you going (to)?)

Furthermore, _wohin_ is separable into _wo_ + _hin_:

- _Wo_ ist mein Schuh _hin_? (Where did my shoe go?)

The same goes for _woher_ (where from):

- _Woher_ kommst du? (Where are you from)

might become

- _Wo_ kommst du _her_?

| English    | German  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| where      | wo      |
| where to   | wo*hin* |
| where from | wo*her* |

#### _Wann_ (when)

_Wann_ (when) does not change depending on the case. _Wann_ can be used with conjunctions such as _seit_ (since) or _bis_ (till):

- _Seit wann_ wartest du? (Since when have you been waiting?)

- _Bis wann_ geht der Film? (Till when does the movie last?).

Don't confuse _w**a**nn_ with _w**e**nn_ which you learned in Conjunctions. Both translate to "when" in English, but they have different functions in German.

- _W**a**nn_ kommst du? (When are you coming?)

- Ich schlafe nicht, _w**e**nn_ ich Musik höre. (I don't sleep when I listen to music)

#### _Warum_ (why)

_Warum_ (why) is also not declinable. It will never change endings. _Wieso_, _Weshalb_, and _Weswegen_ can be used instead of _Warum_. There's no difference in meaning.

Here is an example. All four following sentences mean "Why is the car so old?".

- _Warum_ ist das Auto so alt?

- _Wieso_ ist das Auto so alt?

- _Weshalb_ ist das Auto so alt?

- _Weswegen_ ist das Auto so alt?

#### _Wie viel_ vs. _wie viele_

_Wie viel_ is used with uncountable or countable nouns (how much/how many), and **_wie viele_ is only used with countable nouns** (how many). Some people think that "wie viel" can only be used with uncountable nouns, but that is not true.

- _Wie viel_ Milch trinkst du? (How much milk do you drink?)

- _Wie viel(e)_ Tiere siehst du? (How many animals do you see?)
