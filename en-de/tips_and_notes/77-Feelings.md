### Long and short vowels

#### Which sounds are there?

In German, every vowel can be long or short. The short one often sounds more open than the long one.

The IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is given for the geeks among you :) But you can also copy/paste one of these symbols into Wikipedia to get an in-depth explanation of it (with sound!).

| vowel | short | IPA | long  | IPA  |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|------|
| a     | Mann  | /a/ | Bahn  | /aː/ |   
| ä     | Bälle | /ɛ/ | Käse  | /ɛː/ |   
| e     | rennen| /ɛ/ | Beere | /eː/ |   
| i     | Mitte | /ɪ/ | ziehen| /iː/ |   
| o     | oft   | /ɔ/ | ohne  | /oː/ |   
| ö     | Hölle | /œ/ | schön | /øː/ |   
| u     | Mutter| /ʊ/ | Buch  | /uː/ |   
| ü     | Müll  | /ʏ/ | Bücher| /yː/ |

#### When is a vowel short or long?

German has a range of spelling convention which will clearly show whether a vowel is short or long:

A vowel before a double consonant will be short:

* Mann, denn, Mutter, Bälle, backen, Pizza, Katze

Note that instead of "zz" (which only occurs in the Italian "Pizza"), German uses *tz*. Instead of "kk", we use *ck*.

There are also some signals that clearly show the vowel is long.

Sometimes, the vowel will be doubled:

* p*aa*r, B*ee*re, B*oo*t, … (this only happens with *a/e/o*)

There might be a silent *h* behind the vowel:

* f*ah*ren, z*äh*len, s*eh*en, *ih*r, *oh*ne, h*öh*er, *Uh*r, St*üh*le, …

Note that if you read the list above, you should not hear a single *h* sound. It is *geh|en*, not *ge|hen*.

For *i*, it is more common to have an *-e* after it (sometimes even *-eh*):

* d*ie*, B*ie*ne, sp*ie*len, s*ie*ben, Bez*ieh*ung, …

Again, the *h* will be silent: *Be|zieh|ung*, not *Be|zie|hung*.

But sometimes, there will not be a signal.

The following examples have an unmarked long vowel:

* B*u*ch, d*a*, *A*bend, w*o*, Not, Zitr*o*ne, …

And here are some short ones:

* *a*n, *O*nkel, *u*n-, M*a*m*a*, H*ä*lfte, Z*i*trone, …

For these, you just have to trust your language feeling, it will normally not be a big problem :)
