### The third case.

German has four cases. You already learned two so far, nominative and accusative.

Nominative is used for sentence subjects.

Accusative is mostly used for sentence objects. Some prepositions will use accusative, too.

The third important case is "dative".

### Dative pronouns

Here are the first three dative pronouns for you, together with the nominative and accusative counterparts:

| Nom.       | Akk. | Dat. |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- |
| ich        | mich | mir  |
| du         | dich | dir  |
| sie (fem.) | sie  | ihr  |

#### What is dative for?

As the accusative, the dative case has several functions.

Some **prepositions** go with dative:

- mit, zu, aus, von, bei

- Komm _mit mir_! (Come _with me_!)
- Ich gehe _zu ihr_. (I go _to her_.)

For most verbs, the object is in the accusative case:

- Ich sehe _dich_. (I see _you_.)

A few **verbs use the dative** instead:

- Ich helfe _dir_. (I help _you_.)
- Ich danke _dir_. (I thank _you_.)

Some **verbs have two objects**. The one identifying the "other person involved in a transaction" will also be in dative:

- Ich habe einen Hund. (I have a dog.)
- Ich gebe _dir_ einen Hund. (I give _you_ a dog.)

These three cases will appear in most sentences, so take your time to get a feeling for them.

There is a fourth case (genitive), but it is not used a lot.

### Telling the time

Germans mostly use a system similar to English. There is one important and confusing difference: While English uses "half past seven", German will say "half eight".

| Time  |                   |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 10:00 | zehn (Uhr)        |
| 10:05 | fünf nach zehn    |
| 10:15 | viertel nach zehn |
| 10:30 | halb elf          |
| 10:45 | viertel vor elf   |
| 10:55 | fünf vor elf      |

In addition, the 25 and 35 minutes will refer to the half hour:

| Time  |                    |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 10:25 | fünf vor halb elf  |
| 10:35 | fünf nach halb elf |

This colloquial system only uses hours from one to twelve.

German official time uses hours from zero to 24:

| Time  |                            |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| 10:12 | zehn Uhr zwölf             |
| 22:50 | zweiundzwanzig Uhr fünfzig |

### _Komm!_

Similar to English, the imperative omits the pronoun. You will learn more about this later. For now, just remember that to say "Come (on)!", German uses _Komm!_ (not _kommst_, as you might have suspected).
