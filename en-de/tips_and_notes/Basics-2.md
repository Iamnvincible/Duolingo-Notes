### German plurals are also strange :)

In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding _-(e)s_ at the end of the word. In German, the transformation is more complex. You will learn details about this in a later lesson.

In some languages (such as French or Spanish), genders are also differentiated in the plural. In German, the **plural form does not depend on what gender** the singular form is.

Regardless of grammatical gender, **all plural nouns take the definite article _die_** (You will later learn how "cases" can modify this). This _does not make them feminine_. The grammatical gender of a word never changes. Like many other words, _die_ is simply used for multiple purposes.

Just like in English, there's **no plural indefinite** article.

| English | German   |
| ------- | -------- |
| a man   | ein Mann |
| men     | Männer   |

### You, you and you

Most languages use different words to address one person, or several people.

In German, when **addressing a single person, use _du_**:

- _Du_ bist mein Kind. (_You_ are my child.)

If you are talking to **more than one person, use _ihr_**:

- _Ihr_ seid meine Kinder. (_You_ are my children.)

Some English speakers would use "y'all" or "you guys" for this plural form of "you".

Note that these only work for people you are familiar with (friends, family, …). For others, you would use the formal "you", which we teach later in this course. So stay tuned :)

### _Ihr_ vs. _er_

If you're new to German, _ihr_ and _er_ may sound confusingly similar, but there is actually a difference. _ihr_ sounds similar to the English word "ear", and _er_ sounds similar to the English word "air" (imagine a British/RP accent).

Don't worry if you can't pick up on the difference at first. You may need some more listening practice before you can tell them apart. Also, try using headphones instead of speakers.

**Learn the pronouns together with the verb endings**. This will greatly reduce the amount of ambiguity.

### Verb conjugation

Here is the complete table for conjugating regular verbs:

Example: _trinken_ (to drink)

| English person          | ending | German example           |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| I                       | -e     | **ich** trink**e**       |
| you (singular informal) | -st    | **du** trink**st**       |
| he/she/it               | -t     | **er/sie/es** trink**t** |
| we                      | -en    | **wir** trink**en**      |
| you (plural informal)   | -t     | **ihr** trink**t**       |
| they                    | -en    | **sie** trink**en**      |

Notice that the first and the third person plural have the same ending.

And here's the complete table for the irregular verb _sein_ (to be):

| English                     | German            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| I am                        | **ich bin**       |
| you (singular informal) are | **du bist**       |
| he/she/it is                | **er/sie/es ist** |
| we are                      | **wir sind**      |
| you (plural informal) are   | **ihr seid**      |
| they are                    | **sie sind**      |

You will learn about the distinction between "formal" and "informal" later (it's easy).
